We are currently working on the next update for the Study Guide!

This **free** upgrade will include additional SAMPs, rapid fire questions as well as links to additional resources and guidelines. We are also working on a new "**Quick Pix**" section which will include dermatology photos and questions.&nbsp;

We hope to get this update to you shortly before the CFPC exam in April ! When you have time, please complete the feedback survey included in the App!&nbsp;

Due to the overwhelming support for the "Study Buddy" we are already in a position to start partnering with great charities ! We'll keep you posted. Check out this website or our Facebook Page for more informationâ€¦
